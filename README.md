# SPARTACapstone

A Capstone Project for Data Engineering Pathway in Smarter Philippines Through R&D, Training and Adoption (SPARTA) Year 4.


**Instruction and Overview of the project.**

**A. Create a relational database that will be used to recreate the dashboard for Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) indicators. **

Think of a problem that can be solved by collecting and integrating at least 2 datasets from openstat.psa.gov.ph. You could also look at a problem/situation in your LGU (Local Government Unit) or your organization. Collect any available datasets from them or conduct your own survey if you have the time. 

Design an Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD) using the entities (tables) from the collected data to show their relationships.  

Feel free to consider other data sources that could enrich the database/dashboard with the given indicators. You may use any of the tools, software, or applications you used in your previous courses as deemed appropriate. 

**B. Create the normalized and dimensional models (data engineering models) of your integrated dataset that would be able to recreate the dashboard for SDG indicators found in dashboards.sdgindex.org. **

**C. Create SQL scripts that can be used to migrate the data based on the normalized and dimensional models. There should be one set of scripts per model. **
